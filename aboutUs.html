					<p id="vedixStoryContentDetails">
						Vedix is the brainchild of Chaitanya Nallan, Sangram Simha, and
						Veerendra Shivhare, who founded IncNut in 2011. The company has been
						running two lifestyle media platforms since then - Momjunction and
						Stylecraze. Upon promoting many beauty and wellness brands on these
						sites, IncNut received the most valuable and remarkable feedback
						from the audiences, which revealed that most women are frustrated
						with their constant trials to find the right product for their skin
						and hair.

						While every skin and hair type is different and has varied concerns
						to address, products with generic formulations have not been
						satisfactory. This motivated the founders to explore Ayurveda, which
						brings in customized (dosha-based) and holistic approaches to
						address various skin and hair issues. Their journey to understand
						why most products do not work on every consumer and how Ayurveda can
						cater most effective customized solutions without side effects led
						to the inception of Vedix, the first and only customized Ayurvedic
						brand in India.
